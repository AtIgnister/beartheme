## How do I install this?  
1. Download the latest release and install it as an [unpacked extension.](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/)  
2. Go to the settings page of the extension and add a repo url. To do that, you just need to copy paste the url of the repo into the text box and click the save button. The URL of the official repo is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AtIgnister/beartheme/refs/heads/main/serv/theme.json. The list is comma seperated, so you can add more than one repo.
3. Have fun!
